            // <div class="carousel-container"> is a container that holds the entire carousel.
            // Inside the carousel container, there are three <div> elements with the class carousel-slide. Each of these contains an <img> tag pointing to a different image file. These represent the individual slides of the carousel.
            // The alt attribute in the <img> tags provides alternative text for the images, which is useful for accessibility and when the images cannot be displayed.
            // Two buttons with the classes prev-btn and next-btn are included for navigating between the slides. The text content of these buttons is < (less than) and > (greater than), which are common symbols for "previous" and "next."
            // <script src="script.js"></script> links an external JavaScript file named script.js. This file likely contains the logic to handle the carousel's functionality, such as sliding images and responding to button clicks. -->
