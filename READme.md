Hi and welcome to my Repository

you will find here a simple instruction within my solution for creating an image carousel using Html, CSS & Javascript.

also i will put 3 of my images into this file so you can use them in case of need:D

i hope you enjoy it and maybe it is an inspiration for your own way to do it
or
it merges to your project... ;D

if you have questions to this code or another one of my repo's leave me a comment or mail me via github mail
